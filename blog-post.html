        <strong><p>I have quite a busy life, so there is always not enough time for me to eat.</p></strong> 
        <br/>

        For this reason, I prefer fast food places. I like when I don’t need to wait for my order for 20-30 minutes. Apart from this, burgers, pizzas and other similar things are very tasty. Yet, there are more places that I like even more than any fast food restaurants – these are my top 10 restaurants in New York.
        <br/>

        <strong>1. Rubirosa </strong>
        <p>There are as many reasons as there are items on Rubirosa’s menu to suffer the long wait for a table there — from the loaded steamed artichoke to the sweet, creamy vodka pizza. This, a New Yorker knows. Gluten-free diners and groups are especially well-suited to dining here.</p>
        <br/>

        <strong>2. Quality Italian</strong>
        <p> The mains include the usual array of pork chops and branzinos and veal chop Milanese, but the star of the show is the namesake dish, a chicken parmigiana that looks more like an artisan pizza than what grandma served for dinner.</p>
        <br/>

        <strong>3. The Smith </strong>
        <p> The Smith is one of the best restaurants in NYC when you’re looking for a spot that has a little something for everyone. Serving up breakfast, lunch, and dinner, they have quite the variety of menu options. Some of our favorites include the avocado toast or the skillet roasted mac and cheese.</p>
        <br/>

        <strong>4. Luke’s Lobster</strong>
        <p> You’ll find plenty of options to try this east coast favorite out at NYC restaurants but the best (and by far the most popular) are found at Luke’s Lobster. They keep things simple- a quarter pound of lobster served on a buttered, griddled New England split-top bun with a swipe of mayo, a dash of lemon butter and a sprinkle of our Secret Seasoning.</p>
        <br/>

        <strong>5. Rubirosa </strong>

        <p> This restaurant is located in New York near Central Park. I like to visit this place every time when I want to think about something or spend time with my close friends. I also like to walk in this park, and to end my walk with a dinner in this restaurant. The view on the park is very beautiful which makes feel calm and peaceful. It is great that it has an outdoor dining space. Yet, it is better to have a dinner inside when the weather is too hot. The atmosphere inside is also great. There are a great number of small tables and cozy chairs and sofas. It is very comfortable to sit on them with a small company of people. Yet, it is also possible to come here with a big company and celebrate some special event, like anniversary or engagement. The light here is pleasant. The only minus in this place is the great number of people every day. It can be hard to find a place to sit and when there are too many people, the place is too loud for me.  However, the atmosphere is not the only thing that I like in this restaurant. I also like the service. The waiters are very nice and do everything possible to satisfy their clients. A couple of times, I wasn’t satisfied that my order isn’t ready for a too long period of time. However, my waiter patiently explained me the situation and ask me to taste some of their wines. As this restaurant is very famous for its wines, I decided that it was a great idea to taste a good thing.</p>
